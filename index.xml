      <description>While many career opportunities yield symmetrical rewards, there are brief moments that can have outsized impact on your career trajectory. These pivotal moments, whether it be a meeting with a high-level executive or a small action with a large impact, require careful attention and recognition to make the most of the opportunity. Volunteering for activities with visibility or impact is one of the strongest ways to directly impact your career. Don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on hitting those sixes to no balls in your career - identify and seize pivotal moments for asymmetric returns.</description>

      <description>(A view of Hunza Valley, Pakistan)
Consistency is a crucial factor that can significantly impact one&amp;rsquo;s personal and professional life. It is often overlooked and not given the attention it deserves. People tend to view consistency as a property or characteristic of some kind, rather than a strategic advantage in a competitive sense.
As I have had conversations with individuals in leadership roles, such as CEOs, CTOs, professors, and entrepreneurs, I have realized that they see consistency as a key to their success.</description>

      <title>Developing a reasonable understanding of GPUs for ML Workloads</title>
      <link>https://umerjamil16.github.io/posts/gpus-1/</link>

      <description>This blog is intended to develop a “breadth” level understanding of GPUs, and not a “depth” level. My aim will be to build a “reasonable” understanding that will help in our hardware decision-making for managing ML/DL workloads and pipelines from the perspective of an ML/MLOps Engineer. This blog does not contain comparisons of different GPU architectures for ML workloads.
Before diving, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly recap some key terminologies which will be used in upcoming paras.</description>

      <title>Containerizing Kaldi - the speech recognition toolkit</title>

      <description>Kaldi is a very popular Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) toolkit. In my experience, setting up Kaldi on a system can take huge amount of time. Therefore, it is best to use containerization approach.
Following is the Dockerfile that I wrote. We will be using a cuda enabled Ubuntu 18.04 image from Nvidia NGC:
FROM nvidia/cuda:11.1.1-cudnn8-devel-ubuntu18.04 LABEL Author=&amp;#34;umerjamil16@github.io&amp;#34; Email=&amp;#34;umer1694@gmail.com&amp;#34; LABEL Description=&amp;#34;Kaldi ASR Image&amp;#34; Vendor=&amp;#34;x&amp;#34; Version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34; RUN sh -c &amp;#39;echo &amp;#34;APT { Get { AllowUnauthenticated \&amp;#34;1\&amp;#34;; }; };&amp;#34; &amp;gt; /etc/apt/apt.</description>
