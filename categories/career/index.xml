People tend to view consistency as a property or characteristic of some kind, rather than a strategic advantage in a competitive sense.
As I have had conversations with individuals in leadership roles, such as CEOs, CTOs, professors, and entrepreneurs, I have realized that they see consistency as a key to their success.</description>
