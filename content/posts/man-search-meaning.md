The article is a compilation of my observations and reflections while reading "Man's Search for Meaning" by Dr. Victor Frankl and listening to Dr. Jordan Peterson's lectures on uncovering the psychological significance of Biblical stories. Dr. Frankl, a Holocaust survivor who endured the concentration camps of Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, Kaufering, and Türkheim, has authored 29 books based on his experiences. Dr. Peterson is a distinguished clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Toronto.

  

I have arrived in my room, yet my heart feels far away. Is that place a distant Auschwitz, or the meadows and mountains of Gilgit Baltistan that I once trekked through? I contemplate what it must have been like to be a prisoner in a Nazi Concentration Camp, to face the ultimate manifestation of human malevolence, evil, tragedy, and the tyranny of social structures. I also wonder about our own potential to create a similar environment, to turn our lives into another Auschwitz or Dachau.

  

I found myself questioning the decision and the logic behind it, and the resentment within me arose against life's unfairness. I felt entitled to behave like the SS guards, but I asked myself if I truly had justification or if the unfairness was so obvious. I then switched roles and imagined myself as a prisoner in Auschwitz, wondering how my human spirit would react to such ultimate tragedy and evil. Would I have the right to be resentful for everything that had been taken from me, or is there a better way to move forward? Could I still exercise my freedom to conduct myself in a manner that transcends the suffering of my existence, rather than seek revenge against God and its creation? Would I have the freedom to make that decision?

  

As I have delved deeper into the horrors that occurred in Nazi Concentration Camps, I have become increasingly aware of the potential for chaos and destruction that exists within my own heart. Humans are capable of inflicting immense evil upon themselves and others, amplifying the suffering of life. While animals may attack and kill, humans possess the ability to make one another suffer in ways that are unimaginable. The history of atrocities that humans have committed against each other is endless, often justified by the unfairness of social structures and the tragedies of life. The pit of despair is never-ending, as there is always the possibility of making things even worse. This is true for our own existence and the structures of our lives. As a result, I find myself struggling to answer the difficult questions that arise when faced with such unspeakable cruelty.

  
  
  
  
  

I pondered over the solution to the malevolence that resides within us. How can we overcome the bitterness and animosity we hold against the structure of life and ourselves? What is the path towards progress when we face suffering, chaos, humiliation, and uncertainty? Why is it essential to face the unknown and confront the chaos in life? Why is it necessary to take responsibility and rise above spiteful agony? Why should we be willing to give up the things we cherish the most? Why must we hold ourselves accountable for our actions in the face of nihilism? Why is it crucial to pursue arduous tasks instead of opting for convenient ones? What should be our purpose and meaning in life? Above all, how can we sustain ourselves against the malevolence of existence?

  
  
  
  
  

These questions are not trivial but reveal a person's character and attitude towards life. The answers to these questions are crucial to finding a way forward in life. However, to find these answers, a person must experience a major shift that shatters their belief system, forcing them to rebuild from scratch.

  

I used to be dominated by nihilism about 3-4 years ago, but as I progressed through life, I found it increasingly difficult to maintain that perspective. Nihilism did not provide the answers I needed at the level of analysis required. The cost of nihilism was high - more resentment towards life. However, nihilism also comes with its own advantage, as it allows one to abdicate responsibility. One can easily see the rationale in nihilism, as its basic premise is that everything is random and meaningless. Therefore, what you do or don't do does not matter, and you can conduct yourself as horribly as you want without suffering the consequences.

  
  

The reality of life is that it involves suffering, and this fact cannot be ignored. Though it may be difficult to accept, it is important to do so in order to take responsibility for oneself and find meaning in life. Instead of allowing suffering to consume us, we must learn to transcend it. This means conducting ourselves in a way that reduces suffering for ourselves and for others. It's important to remember that suffering is bottomless and can always get worse, so it's vital that we work towards reducing it whenever possible. Ultimately, the purpose of life is to find meaning in the face of suffering and to work towards reducing it.

  
  
  
  
  

It is important to identify the root cause of suffering. Typically, suffering arises from existential conditions that are beyond our control. However, accepting the source of suffering can help us transcend it. By acknowledging the factors that contribute to our suffering, we can rise above it and find meaning in our pursuit of truth. Taking responsibility for our actions can also give us a sense of purpose and help us overcome the challenges we face.

  
  
  
  
  

From my personal experience, identifying the root cause of suffering is possible by effectively communicating it through speech and writing. By articulating our suffering, we can turn it into a challenge that can be overcome. Victor Frankl, a renowned psychologist, believed that suffering loses its meaning when it has a purpose. Jordan Peterson, in his book "12 Rules of Life" and Biblical series, emphasizes the significance of concise speech in shaping our lives. The power of speech to articulate our thoughts and turn chaos into order is a divine attribute. As humans created in the image of God, we inherit this ability to transform chaos into order through the power of speech.

  
  
  
  
  

Speech is not the only thing we need to articulate to find meaning in suffering. Our sense of self is also often in a state of chaos, lacking integration. As I mentioned earlier, there is a dark side within us that we cannot deny. To do so only makes it stronger, and it becomes a stranger to us. Integrating this darkness, which is also known as the shadow in psychoanalytic theory, can provide us with great power and freedom. A well-integrated shadow allows us to stand firm in saying "no" when we need to confront malevolence in others.

  

In conclusion, these ideas highlight the importance of self-reflection and the power of language in understanding and dealing with the challenges of life. While the baseline condition of life may be suffering, the ability to articulate and pinpoint the source of that suffering can help us transcend it and find meaning. Furthermore, integrating our dark side and accepting our inherent capacity for evil can give us the strength to confront malevolence in the world. Through this process of self-discovery and self-mastery, we can attain a sense of freedom and purpose in life. It is a journey that requires a shift in our belief system and the willingness to confront difficult truths, but the rewards are invaluable.
